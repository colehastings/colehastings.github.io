		<h1>My Youtube Channel</h1>
		<h2>
		<br>
		<p id = "first-sentence">Before you dive into my videos, I'll give you a little background on my YouTube channel, and why I started it.</p><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've always enjoyed YouTube.  For the majority of the time I've spent on Youtube throughout my life, I would watch gaming videos, music videos, and other nonsense that gave me instant gratification to pass the time.  But around 6 months ago, I realized just how powerful the platform of Youtube really is.</p><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can learn (virtually) anything on YouTube.  How to tie a tie, how to jump start a car battery, how to code (I learned how to do most of this website from YouTube), etc.  I knew this, but had never thought to start searching for topics to grow myself, and my well being.  I still don't know what prompted that initial start to Personal Development,but once I found my first videos on confidence, meditation, and developing a <a href="https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/">"growth mindset"</a>, I was instantly hooked and hungry for more.  These past 6 months have been an incredibly enlightening and engaging experience as I continue to delve deeper into my subconscious mind and my true abilities.</p><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even before I was learning from YouTube and instead using it as a way to procrastinate, I had always wanted to post my own videos.  My problem?  I never had the motivation and thought I lacked the skill neccessary to develop quality content. After I changed my mindset and habits to ones that would help me grow myself for the rest of my life, I realized that these were just excuses.  With a little dedication to learning the creator side of YouTube and the editing software, I could produce and share all of the ideas and lessons I've learned on this journey to my friends, family, or anyone trying to genuinely better themselves.</p><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So without further ado, here are my videos (with the newest at the top, and the oldest at the bottom).  My channel is based solely around Personal Development, and I hope YOU can develop some new habits or mindsets from these videos, just as I have too.</p>
